<h2> Hosting Options </h2>
<p>There are many buying and hosting domain names. A few of these names include iPage, HostGator, Sitegrounds, and many more. <br> <br>
Different hosting options appeal to different levels of user. What works for a blogger who only has a few viewers will not be optimal for
 someone with a bustling online marketplace, with hundreds or thousands of daily visitors. <br>
<br>
There are a few hosting services I might be interested in, personally and professionally. These include Sitegrounds, Dreamhost, Amazon AWS, Bluehost, and iPage.
<br>
<br>
I'm interested in <a href="https://www.siteground.com/web-hosting.htm"> Sitegrounds </a> because I already purchased the student hosting option from them. This allowed me to get the 
"Startup Hosting" plan for 2$ a month, or 24$ for a year. This is a great price for website hosting (only for one website, but I'm only going to focus to one project at a time), more bandwidth than I will likely need, and free SSL and HTTPS certificates.
Regularly, this service costs about 4$ per month. A nice pro of using Sitegrounds is their affordable student hosting option. A con might be their more expensive plans apart from student hosting.

Because I've been using Sitegrounds for about two years for my personal projects, I'd be interested in learning more about them. I chose Sitegrounds because they are a reputable company with good reviews fro other users online.

<br> <br>
I'm also interested in <a href="https://www.dreamhost.com"> Dreamhost </a>. They seem quite affordable, also are fairly reputable according to Reddit users and online reviews, and work well with Wordpress, which is my website building engine of choice. 
Dreamhost has hosting options from as low as $2.59 monthly. The Dreampress option, which automatically updates Wordpress sites and takes care of all backups and security threats, is $16.95 per month. 

I'd consider the Dreampress option to be a pro. However, it's also a con because it's quite expensive when there are much more affordable alternatives.

<br> <br>
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com"> Amazon's AWS service </a> wasn't on the lists in the Content section of Eagle Online, but it's a hosting option I am interested in, in the future. From what I've seen, Amazon cloud based hosting services such as Lightsail and AWS allow a user to create and host static sites or apps
for far cheaper than traditional hosting options. It does require some additional user knowledge and skill to properly implement, which I don't have at this time. I'm always learning though! It was tough getting an actual price for hosting for AWS. It can range from pennies per month.
You can also set a limit on how much you're willing to pay, such as 10$ a month for a static site. 
The most obvious pro is the customizability and affordability of the AWS service. A con would be that it's more complex to set up and requires additional knowledge not covered in the scope of our classes, which would have to be learned on my own.

I also find the hosting service <a href="https://www.fatcow.com"> Fatcow </a> to be interesting. It offers similar capabilities as other hosting for as low as $4.08 per month. What's interesting about Fatcow is that they use 
windpower to power their hosting equipment. Ecologically friendly! They also offer WP Essential, a program designed to help 
users with WordPress. It claims to help the site run faster, detect malware, and integrate themes and plugins more effectively.
<br>
The "pro" for this is the fact that they use wind power to power their server rooms.
One "con" for Fatcow is that it has low reviews online. I'm not sure I could actually trust their service given that fact, despite the cool ecological gimmick.

<a href="https://www.ionos.com/hosting/web-hosting"> 1&1  <a> is another hosting company I'm interested in learning more about. I actually used 1&1 to buy a domain name once, but never ended up hosting it or doing much with it. 
I've heard many mixed reviews about 1&1. It's what James Goudy, one of my favorite teachers at FVCC, uses for his projects. However, many reviews online indicate that the tech support is minimal 
and even that they tend to unethically charge users who do not manage to cancel in time. I noticed after signing up that I had to jump through several hoops just to cancel automatic renewal, and if I hadn't inspected closely I could have easily kept being charged. I find 
practices like this to be unethical and to indicate untrustworthiness. 1&1 is quite cheap, frequently offering deals and sales, dipping as low as 
.99$ per month for special introductory sales.
A pro would be that a teacher who's opinion I respect, James Goudy, has recommended the 1&1 service and has been a long-time user. 
A con would be my own instinctive mistrust of their unethical business practices, and negative reviews online complaining of the same.
