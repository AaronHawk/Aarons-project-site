<h2> The Mountain Flower </h2>
<p>Listen to me, mountain dweller...
I don't want to hurt your feelings,
<br>
But, in fact, even you lack awareness<br>
Of impermanence and death, <br>
Let alone any realization of emptiness. <br>
<br>
For those with such awareness, <br>
Outer phenomena all teach impermanence and death. <br>
I, the flower, will now give you, the yogi, <br>
A bit of helpful advice <br>
On death and impermanence. <br>
<br>
A flower born in a meadow, <br>
I enjoy perfect happiness <br>
With my brightly colored petals in full bloom. <br>
Surrounded by an eager cloud of bees, <br>
I dance gaily, swaying gently with the wind. <br>
When a fine rain falls, my petals warp around me; <br>
When the sun shines I open like a smile. <br>

<br>
Right now I look well enough, <br>
But I won't last long. <br>
Not at all. <br>

Unwelcome frost will dull the vivid colors, <br>
Till turning brown I wither. <br>
Thinking of this, I am disturbed. <br>
Later still, winds-- <br>
Violent and merciless -- <br>
Will tear me apart until I turn to dust... <br>
<br>
You, hermit... <br>
Are of the same nature. <br>
<br>
Surrounded by a host of disciples, <br>
You enjoy a fine complexion, <br>
Your body of flesh and blood is full of life. <br>
When others praise you, you dance with joy; <br>
<br>
Right now, you look well enough. <br>
But you won't last long. <br>
Not at all. <br>
<br>
Unhealthy aging will steal away <br>
Your healthy vigor; <br>
Your hair will whiten<br>
And your back will grow bent... <br>
<br>
When touched by the merciless hands <br>
Of illness and death <br>
You will leave this world <br>
For the next life... <br>
<br>
Since you, mountain-roaming hermit, <br>
And I, a mountain-born flower; <br>
Are mountain friends; <br>
I have offered you <br>
These words of good advice. <br>
Then the flower fell silent and remained still. In reply, I sang: <br>
O brilliant, exquisite flower, <br>
Your discourse on impermanence<br>
Is wonderful indeed. <br>
But what shall the two of us do? <br>
Is there nothing that can be done? <br>
<br>

The flower replied: <br>
Among all the activities of samsara, <br>
There is not one that is lasting. <br>
<br>

Whatever is born will die; <br>
Whatever is joined will come apart; <br>
Whatever is gathered will disperse; <br>
Whatever is high will fall. <br>
<br>
Having considered this, <br>
I resolve not to be attached <br>
To these lush meadows,<br>
Even now, in the full glory of my display,<br>
Even as my petals unfold in splendor... <br>
<br>
You too, while strong and fit <br>
Should abandon your clinging... <br>
Seek the pure field of freedom, <br>
The great serenity.
